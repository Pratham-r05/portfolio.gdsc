Hey yash i heard you'r intersted to know what android developement exactly is .....
So you remember we watch black panther movie ,there was a (vibranium) name metal which gave power to their whole city and black panther itself
Same as Vibranium Android is a type of OS that powers many phones and tablets. Do you have a phone or tablet with Android on it? Great, then you can see it in action!

Now, let me explain what it means to develop for Android. When we say "develop," we mean creating something new, like a game or an app, that can run on Android devices. It's like building a toy or a game that people can play with on their phone or tablet.

To make something for Android, we need to use a special tool called Android Studio. It's like a magic box that helps us create all sorts of cool things. It's kind of like having a set of Legos that we can use to build something awesome!

Once we have Android Studio, we can use it to create all sorts of things, like buttons, pictures, and even sounds. We can put them all together to make a fun game or a useful app that people can use on their phone or tablet.

When we're done building our app, we can send it to the Google Play Store. This is a big store where people can download all sorts of apps and games for their Android devices. And just like that, our app is available for people to download and use!

So, in short, Android development is about using a special tool to build cool things that people can use on their phone or tablet. It's like having a set of Legos that we can use to make something awesome!
